                        Richard Kasendwa aka Ziza Bafana started his professional music career in 2011 and he has never
                        looked back hence becoming one of the best new school artists. Not very many artists of this
                        generation stand out artistically but Ziza Bafana is proving to be a master of his unique
                        dancehall music genre. <br><br>

                        This is a super showcase in his music composition and performances. Any journey is not
                        worthwhile without any achievements or accolades and this is evident as he is a three times
                        Zzina Awards winner, three times HiPiPo Awards winner, two times rising Star Awards winner and
                        Best of the Best Awards winner. <br><br>

                        Being one of the most outstanding artists in Uganda and one of the best performers, Ziza Bafana
                        has also managed to tour around the world showcasing his artistry in countries like South
                        Africa, United Kingdom, Turkey, E.A, Sweden, Amsterdam and Southern Sudan. <br><br>

                        For any serious artist, work has to do the talking more than anything else and he has managed
                        to put out a number of big songs plus albums like Jayo Ntekeyo, Pomini, Guluma Nasomye,
                        Mavuunya, Jocker, Batutunze, Akalulu, Doom Doom (Hidden), Agende, Sagala Ntalo, Osiliiza,
                        Kankunune respectively. And he promises more to come as he is also planning to launch the Ziza
                        Bafana Foundation that caters for the Girl Child.

                            Kenzo was born in Masaka, a town in the central region of Uganda. He lost his mother at age 5, after which he lived a street life for 13 years. After high school, he adopted the stage name Eddy Kenzo and began writing music. In 2008, he was featured in the popular song Yanimba by Mikie Wine.[1] His breakthrough 2010 song, Stamina, was met with critical acclaim and was used as a theme song for Yoweri Museveni's presidential campaign.[3] He released the album Ogenda Kunzisa in 2012. One year later, he released Kamunguluze and toured the United States.

                             The song Sitya Loss became his most popular song to date, and a video of the Ugandan children Triplets Ghetto Kids dancing to the song went viral. Its success led to the launching of a petition to have the dancing children appear on The Ellen DeGeneres Show.[4][5] Kenzo released the album Sitya Loss in May 2014.[citation needed] <br><br>

                            Eddy Kenzo has one daughter, Maya Musuuza Mirembe born 2011, from a previous relationship with Tracy Nabatanzi.[6] Kenzo retained custody of his daughter after the split.[7] In 2014, Kenzo had another daughter Aamaal Musuuza through a relation with Rema Namakula his current girlfriend.[8] <br><br>
